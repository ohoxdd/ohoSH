## Introduction

Simple Shell project written in C, trying to be as low-level as possible

Just finished taking my Operating Systems class in my 2nd semester of Computer Engineering, and really wanted to tackle this project for a while.
Guided by this blog, which can be found at the practical-tutorials/project-based-learning repository:
    https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/

## Usage

Compile with make, and execute as a normal program in a GNU/Linux system. Built-in commands are cd, exit, and help.
